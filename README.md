# Konane AI 
# Made by Tafroze and Sam (Robert).
A.I. that plays Konane.

Significant contributions by both members.
(i.e., using OOP we were able to get alot done in less time)
We broke some OOP rules (some things made public, some global variables) in the name of speed
For the tournament, the AI must decide on a move in 15 seconds or forfeit.
I hope to make a final product that takes a bit longer but works better and with better code organization.
I realize there are several files in this at the moment.
Konane is an effective AI, but not optimal
KonaneDoubleJump is broken
KonaneAgain is functional and competitive (though the test output is strange, the results are correct)

I plan to re-factor the code as much as possible to make it more OOP
